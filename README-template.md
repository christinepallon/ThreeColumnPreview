## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

After struggling in the last challenge, I managed to get this one done much quicker. I feel like I've gotten a much better grasp on media queries after these past two challenges, and am now more used to just working with variables for colors.

### Continued development

For my next project, I want to practie using shorthand properties for margin, padding, border-radius, etc. rather than using left, right, top, bottom.
